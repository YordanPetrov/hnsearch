Hacker News Search for OSX 
--------------------------

Lately, I find myself using the Search tool of [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) more and more. Inspired by [QR Codify](http://zacharyvoase.com/2013/03/06/qr-codify/), I decided to write my own script so I can search anything I want on the Hacker News website. If you think that could be useful for you - feel free to try it out. 

Usage
-----
1. download the hnsearch archive
2. extract and run the .worlflow file
